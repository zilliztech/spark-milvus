# Working in this repository

[README.md](../README.md) covers installing the toolchain, building the
jar and running the example. This file covers what a contributor needs beyond
that.

## Project ids

sbt project ids cannot contain a dot, so the id and the directory differ for the
Spark lines. The directory is `spark-4.0`, the id is `spark40`, and the publish
coordinate is `spark-milvus-4.0`. The same split applies to `apps-4.0` /
`apps40` and `integration-4.0` / `integration40`.

Per-module commands take the id as a prefix:

```bash
sbt core/test spark40/compile apps40/test
sbt spark35/compile spark41/compile spark42/compile   # cross-line check
```

The root project has no sources of its own. It depends on `spark40` and
`apps40` and exists to assemble the fat jar under the 1.x artifact name, so the
Dockerfile and the cloud consumers do not have to change.

## Tests that cannot pass locally

Two tests need `libmilvus-storage-jni`, which is built inside the Docker image
and not on a developer machine. They fail with `UnsatisfiedLinkError` and that
is expected:

- `MilvusStorageFFITest`
- `MilvusStorageMultiFileGroupTest`

Everything else passes. A green run looks like this:

| Module | Tests |
|---|---|
| core | 32 |
| compat | 43 |
| client | 20 |
| spark-4.0 | 261, of which the two above fail locally |
| apps-4.0 | 212 |

`integration-4.0` needs a real Milvus on 19530 and MinIO on 9000; it compiles in
CI but is not run there.

## JVM version

Use Java 21. On Java 26 every test that starts a SparkSession aborts with
`UnsupportedOperationException: getSubject is not supported`, because
`Subject.getSubject` was removed and Spark still calls it. The failure looks
like a code problem and is not one.

## How tests find their fixtures

Several suites read fixture files by a path relative to the repository root, for
example `core/src/test/data/seg_manifest.avro`. Forked tests would otherwise run
with the subproject as their working directory, so `Modules.nativeTest` pins
`baseDirectory` back to the build root. If a fixture path suddenly resolves
wrong, that setting is why.

The same settings block supplies the `--add-opens` flags Arrow needs. Without
them the first column batch throws `Failed to initialize MemoryUtil`.

## Formatting

`sbt scalafmtAll` formats every module. Parts of the 1.x tree were never
formatted, so a blanket run touches files unrelated to your change — revert
those before committing rather than mixing them in.

## The protobuf split

`common.proto` and `schema.proto` are generated into `core` with `grpc = false`,
because the storage format itself is defined in protobuf: a snapshot embeds a
`CollectionSchema`. The five files that carry gRPC services are generated into
`client` with `grpc = true`, using an include path so they reference the message
classes core already produced. Neither module generates the same `.proto` twice.

Adding a proto file means deciding which side it belongs on, and adjusting the
`includeFilter` in core or the `excludeFilter` in client to match.

## Jackson

Layer 2 pins jackson-databind, jackson-core and jackson-annotations to one
version, because parquet-hadoop drags in a databind newer than
jackson-module-scala and mixing them throws `JsonMappingException` at runtime.

Do not apply that pin to the Spark lines. Spark ships a self-consistent jackson
set, and pinning there drags databind *below* Spark's own jackson-module-scala,
which throws the same way from the other direction.

## Commits

Write the message in English, explain why rather than what, and name the
verification you actually ran. When a change contradicts a design document, say
so in the message and fix the document in the same commit.
